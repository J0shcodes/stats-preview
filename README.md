## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size

### Screenshot

![](./images/stats_screenshot.png)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it. 

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

**Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.**

## My process

- Started out first with the HTML template.
- Moved on to the design of the webpage using CSS and Flexbox.
- Made changes on the fly to the HTML template when needed. 

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned how to use the CSS flexbox column and column-reverse property to rearrange the order of elements on the webpage.

```css
.card {
    flex-direction: column-reverse;
    align-items: center;
  }

.stats {
    flex-direction: column;
  }  
```

### Useful resources

- [CSS flex-direction](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/flex-direction) - This helped me to chnage the order of the flex items
